This MATLAB package provides  the MLRL metric learning algorithms 
The package contains the following components.

(1) /code: MATLAB codes for the MLRL metric learning algorithms, as well as one demos showing how to use the algorithms. Functions for computing the Mahalanobis distance and the CMC curves are also provided for the evaluation purpose.

(2) /bin: MEX functions for the Retinex image preprocessing. Since we are not allowed to release its source code, we provide MEX functions for both Windows and Linux, x86 and x64 platforms.

(3) /data: the extracted color_texture,LOMO,GOG features for the PRiD450s databases. Due to the size of the feature files, they are provided as separate downloads.https://pan.baidu.com/s/191LjPOKl2RSmU3RceIP15g

If you want to run this demo, Please download our extracted pedestrian features and extract them to the data folder. https://pan.baidu.com/s/191LjPOKl2RSmU3RceIP15g
